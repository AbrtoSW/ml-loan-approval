This is a project to test on how AI can have accurate approvals when it comes to loan lending, this is a prototype so I used a OPENAI api key
to quickly prototype and example on how this project would work, ideally you would create your own LLM model for more control, which i may try to do
in the future. To start simply create a .env file with a OPENAI key. Then start the back-end "MlLoanApprovalProjectApplication", and start the front-end 
"start_frontend.js".
